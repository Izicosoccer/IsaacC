    <h1>History</h1>
        <div><h4>The first competition for the cup was organized in 1930 by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and was won by Uruguay. Held every four years since that time, except during World War II, the competition consists of international sectional tournaments leading to a final elimination event made up of 32 national teams. Unlike Olympic football, World Cup teams are not limited to players of a certain age or amateur status, so the competition serves more nearly as a contest between the world’s best players. Referees are selected from lists that are submitted by all the national associations.The trophy cup awarded from 1930 to 1970 was the Jules Rimet Trophy, named for the Frenchman who proposed the tournament. This cup was permanently awarded in 1970 to then three-time winner Brazil (1958, 1962, and 1970), and a new trophy called the FIFA World Cup was put up for competition. Many other sports have organized “World Cup” competitions.<br>

                <div><h2>Qualifications</h2></div>
                <div><h4>The qualification process can start as early as almost three years before the final tournament and last over a two-year period. The formats of the qualification tournaments differ between confederations. Usually, one or two places are awarded to winners of intercontinental play-offs. For example, the winner of the Oceanian zone and the fifth-placed team from the Asian zone entered a play-off for a spot in the 2010 World Cup. From the 1938 World Cup onwards, host nations receive automatic qualification to the final tournament. This right was also granted to the defending champions between 1938 and 2002, but was withdrawn from the 2006 FIFA World Cup onward, requiring the champions to qualify. Brazil, winners in 2002, were the first defending champions to play qualifying matches.</h4></div>
                
                <div><h2>The Final Tournmanet</h2></div>
                <div><h4>The final tournament format since 1998 has 32 national teams competing over the course of a month in the host nations. There are two stages: the group stage followed by the knockout stage.<br>

In the group stage, teams compete within eight groups of four teams each. Eight teams are seeded, including the hosts, with the other seeded teams selected using a formula based on the FIFA World Rankings or performances in recent World Cups, and drawn to separate groups. The other teams are assigned to different "pots", usually based on geographical criteria, and teams in each pot are drawn at random to the eight groups. Since 1998, constraints have been applied to the draw to ensure that no group contains more than two European teams or more than one team from any other confederation.<br>

Each group plays a round-robin tournament, in which each team is scheduled for three matches against other teams in the same group. This means that a total of six matches are played within a group. The last round of matches of each group is scheduled at the same time to preserve fairness among all four teams.The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage. Points are used to rank the teams within a group. Since 1994, three points have been awarded for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss (before, winners received two points).<br>

<ul>Considering all possible outcomes (win, draw, loss) for all six matches in a group, there are 729 (= 36) combinations possible. However, 207 of these combinations lead to ties between the second and third places. In such case, the ranking among these teams is determined by:

                    
    <li>Greatest combined goal difference in all group matches</li>
    <li>Greatest combined number of goals scored in all group matches</li>
                    </ul>
<ul>If more than one team remain level after applying the above criteria, their ranking will be determined as follows:
    <li>Greatest number of points in head-to-head matches among those teams</li>
    <li>Greatest goal difference in head-to-head matches among those teams</li>
    <li>Greatest number of goals scored in head-to-head matches among those teams</li>
                    </ul>
<ul>Fair play points, defined by the number of yellow and red cards received in the group stage:
    <li>Yellow card: minus 1 point</li>
    <li>Indirect red card (as a result of a second yellow card): minus 3 points</li>
    <li>Direct red card: minus 4 points</li>
    <li>Yellow card and direct red card: minus 5 points</li>
<li>If any of the teams above remain level after applying the above criteria, their ranking will be determined by the drawing of lots
    The knockout stage is a single-elimination tournament in which teams play each other in one-off matches, with extra time and penalty shootouts used to decide the winner if necessary. It begins with the round of 16 (or the second round) in which the winner of each group plays against the runner-up of another group. This is followed by the quarter-finals, the semi-finals, the third-place match (contested by the losing semi-finalists), and the final.</li>
                    </ul>
    
On 10 January 2017, FIFA approved a new format, the 48-team World Cup (to accommodate more teams), which consists of 16 groups of three teams each, with two teams qualifying from each group, to form a round of 32 knockout stage, to be implemented by 2026</h4></div><br>
